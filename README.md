About me:

Hey there, my name is Jethro De Burca.

I study Software engineering at WINTEC. I'm in my second year, and I'm really excited to start my career.

I enjoy making desktop apps with c# .NET, and Java Swing.

I love learning new things, and I hope to create applications that help make peoples lives easier.
